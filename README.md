Hello! I'm Bobby, a recent graduate from Tufts University with a passion for public interest tech! With a strong academic and professional background in mathematics and programing, I'm more than comfortable working on both the data and the engineering side of the coin. I'm currently looking to take my skills and experience to a mission driven and public interest focused project.
